## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Senior marketing strategist with 4+ years leading integrated marketing, PR, and partnerships at a fast-growing Hispanic FinTech — now channeling that foundation into AI-driven performance marketing and paid media strategy. I built a full marketing department from zero, drove 100M+ influencer views, and contributed to 30-40% of new account sign-ups through multicultural campaigns across 60+ U.S. cities.

I am actively advancing my expertise in AI marketing tools, paid social advertising (Meta Ads, Google Ads), and AI-powered campaign optimization — combining data-driven performance thinking with the storytelling and community instinct that has defined my career. Bilingual (English/Spanish), with a proven ability to connect brands to multicultural audiences at scale.
